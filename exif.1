.TH exif 1 "2009-01-21" "exif 0.6.17.1" "libexif command line front-end"
.SH "NAME"
exif \- shows EXIF information in JPEG files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.BI "exif [ " "OPTION" " ] [ " "file..." " ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "exif"
is a small command-line utility to show and change EXIF information in JPEG files.
.PP
Most digital cameras produce EXIF files, which are JPEG files with extra tags that contain information about the image. The
.B "exif"
command-line utility allows you to read EXIF information from and write EXIF information to those files.
.B "exif"
internally uses the
.B "libexif"
library.
.PP
Each input file given on the command line is acted upon in turn, using 
all the options given. Execution will be aborted immediately if one
file is not readable or does not contain EXIF tags.
.PP
As EXIF tags are read, any unknown ones are discarded and known ones are
automatically converted into the correct format, if they aren't already.
Corrupted MakerNote tags are also removed, but no format changes are made.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI "\-v, \-\-version"
Display the exif version number.
.TP
.BI "\-i, \-\-ids"
Show ID numbers instead of tag names.
.TP
.BI "\-t, \-\-tag=" "TAG"
Select only this
.IR "TAG" .
.I "TAG"
is the tag title, the short tag name, or the tag number
(hexadecimal numbers are prefixed with 0x), from the IFD specified
with \-\-ifd.  The tag title is dependent on the current locale, whereas
name and number are locale-independent.
.TP
.BI "\-\-ifd=" "IFD"
Select a tag or tags from this
.IR "IFD" .
Valid IFDs are "0", "1", "EXIF", "GPS", and "Interoperability".
Defaults to "0".
.TP
.BI "\-l, \-\-list\-tags"
List all known EXIF tags and IFDs.  A JPEG image must be provided, and
those tags which appear in the file are shown with an asterisk in the
corresponding position in the list.
.TP
.BI "\-|, \-\-show\-mnote"
Show the contents of the MakerNote tag.  The contents of this tag are nonstandard
(and often undocumented) and may therefore not be recognized, or if they are
recognized they may not necessarily be interpreted correctly.
.TP
.BI "\-\-remove"
Remove the tag or (if no tag is specified) the entire IFD.
.TP
.BI "\-s, \-\-show\-description"
Show description of tag.  The \-\-tag option must also be given.
.TP
.BI "\-e, \-\-extract\-thumbnail"
Extract the thumbnail, writing the thumbnail image to the file specified
with \-\-output.
.TP
.BI "\-r, \-\-remove\-thumbnail"
Remove the thumbnail from the image, writing the new image to the file specified
with \-\-output.
.TP
.BI "-n, \-\-insert\-thumbnail=" "FILE"
Insert
.I "FILE"
as thumbnail.  No attempt is made to ensure that the contents of
.I "FILE"
are in a valid thumbnail format.
.TP
.BI "\-o, \-\-output=" "FILE"
Write output image to
.IR "FILE" .
If this option is not given and an image file must be written, the
name used is the same as the input file with the suffix ".modified.jpeg".
.TP
.BI "\-\-set\-value=" "VALUE"
Set the data for the tag specified with \-\-tag and \-\-ifd to
.IR "VALUE" .
Compound values consisting of multiple components are separated with
spaces.
.TP
.BI "\-c, \-\-create-exif"
Create EXIF data if it does not exist
.TP
.BI "\-m, \-\-machine\-readable"
Produce output in a machine-readable (tab-delimited) format.
The \-\-xml-output and \-\-machine\-readable options are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.BI "\-x, \-\-xml-output"
Produce output in an XML format (when possible).
The \-\-xml-output and \-\-machine\-readable options are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.BI "\-d, \-\-debug"
Show debugging messages. Also, when processing a file that contains corrupted
data, this option cases exif to attempt to continue processing. Normally,
corrupted data causes an abort.
.SS "Help options"
.TP
.BI "\-?, \-\-help"
Show help message.
.TP
.BI "\-\-usage"
Display brief usage message.
