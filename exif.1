.SH "NAME"
exif \- shows EXIF information in JPEG files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.BI "exif [ " "OPTION" " ] " "file"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "exif"
is a small command-line utility to show and change EXIF information in JPEG files.
.PP
Most digital cameras produce EXIF files, which are JPEG files with extra tags that contain information about the image. The
.B "exif"
command line utility allows you to read EXIF information from and write EXIF information to those files.
.PP
.B "exif"
internally uses the
.B "libexif"
library.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI "\-v, \-\-version"

.TP
.BI "\-i, \-\-ids"

.TP
.BI "\-t, \-\-tag=" "tag"
Select only the given EXIF

be given to use this option, but its contents are ignored.
.TP
.BI "\-|, \-\-show\-mnote"

often undocumented) and may therefore not be recognized, or if it is
