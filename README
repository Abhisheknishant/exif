				      EXIF
				      ----

'exif' is a small command-line utility to show EXIF information hidden
in JPEG files. I wrote it to demonstrate the power of libexif.

It depends on 
 * libexif (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif)
 * popt.h

Have fun!

INTERNATIONALIZATION
--------------------

All translations for exif, except ru and en_CA, are coordinated by
the Translation Project at http://translationproject.org/.  This means
that ALL changes to the .po files (except those two exceptions) MUST be
made through the TP web site, or they will be eventually overwritten
and lost.  If you are interested in translating exif into a new
language, simply join TP and start!  A translation disclaimer is NOT
required for exif; by making a translation, you agree implicitly to
provide it under the same license terms as the rest of exif (GPL).
When a new version of exif is available for translation, a exif
maintainer will contact the Translation Project and all interested TP
members will be automatically notified.
